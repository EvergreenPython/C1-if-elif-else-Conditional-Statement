## If/Elif/Else Conditional Statements 
Used for decision-making operations with conditions

Conditional statements always start with an 
`if` header 
`elif` optional, but we can have as many as we want 
`else` optional, but only 1 for every `if` 

### Condition: 
An expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value (AKA. Boolean expression)

### Indentation: 
Python relies on indentation to define scope in the code 

### Formula: 
if (Condition): 
> Body Statement 

elif (Condition): 
> Body Statement 

else: 
> Body Statement 

*Ex. * 
```python
a = 2 
if(a == 0): # False 
  print ("hi")

elif (a != 2): # False
  print ("welcome")

else: 
  print("bye")
```  
> bye
